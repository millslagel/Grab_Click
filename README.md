# Grab_Click
I was tired of dealing with clipgrab so I wrote this basic python script to download MP3s from youtube.  I need mp3s for my guitar trainer - I created this utility.
One small detail - for now you need python installed.  Then it will work.  I am working on an executable.  hopefully soon.
